              We used aerial photographs to measure long‐term loss of forest cover in dry to mesic forests at Pu'u Wa'aWa'a on the island of Hawai'i. The aerial extent of dense forest decreased 62 percent between 1954 and 1994, and the area covered by grassland increased by 237 percent. We then used field data and modeling to evaluate the consequences of removing cattle to the composition, biomass, and flammability of the grass community. Field studies of exclosures demonstrated that grazing reduced biomass of kikuyu grass (
              Pennisetum clandestinum
              ) from 770 to 229 g/m
              2
              , and canopy height from 26.8 to 6.1 cm. Grazed kikuyu was unable to carry fast‐spreading or intense fires (maximum flame length 70 cm, covering 1.4 ha after one hour), while ungrazed kikuyu could carry catastrophic fires (flame lengths 3.0 m, covering {\textgreater}75 ha after one hour). In addition, removing cattle from drier areas allowed the spread of fountain grass (
              Pennisetum setaceum
              ), which created a higher risk of fire due to its architecture and low fuel moistures.},

	abstract = {Frequent wildfires in tropical landscapes dominated by non-native invasive grasses threaten surrounding ecosystems and developed areas. To better manage fire, accurate estimates of the spatial and temporal variability in fuels are urgently needed. We quantified the spatial variability in live and dead fine fuel loads and moistures at four guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) dominated sites. To assess temporal variability, we sampled these four sites each summer for 3 years (2008–2010) and also sampled fuel loads, moistures and weather variables biweekly at three sites for 1 year. Live and dead fine fuel loads ranged spatially from 0.85 to 8.66 and 1.50 to 25.74 Mg ha–1 respectively, and did not vary by site or year. Biweekly live and dead fuel moistures varied by 250 and 54\% respectively, and were closely correlated (P \&lt; 0.05) with soil moisture, relative humidity, air temperature and precipitation. Overall, fine fuels and moistures exhibited tremendous variability, highlighting the importance of real-time, site-specific data for fire prevention and management. However, tight correlations with commonly quantified weather variables demonstrates the capacity to accurately predict fuel variables across large landscapes to better inform management and research on fire potential in guinea grass ecosystems in Hawaii and throughout the tropics.},

              fluxes by determining changes in stocks of soil carbon (C) as a result of land use change is an option for complying nations under the Kyoto Protocol. The 1996 IPCC guidelines for C accounting recommend that soil C stocks to a depth of 30 cm be used in such accounting. However, the soil bulk density often changes with land use and the soil C per unit ground area to a fixed depth will also change even without any change in the mass fraction of C in dry soil. This problem will generally arise when soil C accounting is taken to a fixed depth (i.e. uses ‘spatial coordinates’). For accuracy in determining the land use change effects on soil C, soil sampling should be referred to a fixed dry soil mass per unit ground area (i.e. use ‘cumulative mass coordinates’). There has been intermittent literature‐discussion about this issue over several decades. Methods to accomplish C accounting on a mass coordinate basis, none of them accurate or efficient, have been suggested. Here, we propose a simple, accurate methodology for determining soil C stocks using cumulative mass coordinates, which does not involve repeat sampling trips, nominal specification of the location of boundaries between soil horizons, or independent sampling for determining soil bulk densities. Each core is taken a little (say 10 cm) below the nominal mass/depth required and the retrieved core is sliced into two at a point a little above the nominal mass/depth (say 10 cm above). An accurate determination of the depth of the core or slice is not needed, but an accurate determination of the dry mass of soil above and below the slice‐point is required. Linear interpolation between these two measurements is then used to estimate the cumulative soil C per unit ground area to the target dry soil mass per unit ground area. Even though this method eliminates the need for reporting soil bulk densities for C accounting, it is urged that the bulk densities and density changes still be routinely reported. This is because such information is of fundamental importance for understanding and predicting the movement of fluids and substances carried in them within the soil and between the soil and the environment. Hence, these data are likely to be of fundamental importance in developing our future understanding and predictive capacity of soil C changes with land use change.},

	abstract = {Soil carbon stocks are commonly quantified at fixed depths as the product of soil bulk density, depth and organic carbon (OC) concentration. However, this method systematically overestimates OC stocks in treatments with greater bulk densities such as minimum tillage, exaggerating their benefits. Its use has compromised estimates of OC change where bulk densities differed between treatments or over time periods. We argue that its use should be discontinued and a considerable body of past research re‐evaluated. Accurate OC estimations must be based on quantification in equivalent soil masses (ESMs). The objective of this publication is to encourage accurate quantification of changes in OC stocks and other soil properties using ESM procedures by developing a simple procedure to quantify OC in multiple soil layers. We explain errors inherent in fixed depth procedures and show how these errors are eliminated using ESM methods. We describe a new ESM procedure for calculating OC stocks in multiple soil layers and show that it can be implemented without bulk density sampling, which reduces sampling time and facilitates evaluations at greater depths, where bulk density sampling is difficult. A spreadsheet has been developed to facilitate calculations. A sample adjustment procedure is described to facilitate OC quantification in a single equivalent soil mass layer from the surface, when multiple‐layer quantification is not necessary.},

	abstract = {An energy analysis was performed on the Eucalyptus grandis production system practiced in Hawaii with a system boundary defined as the edge of the plantation. Mass and energy flows crossing this boundary were inventoried over a seven year production rotation and unit factors were applied to convert mass and energy flows to a common energy basis, MJ per hectare. Based on a seven year harvest rotation, energy equivalents of production inputs totaled 46.5 GJ ha−1. Energy used in harvesting, primarily diesel fuel, accounted for ∼70\% of the total energy input to the system. Herbicide and nitrogen fertilizer contributed 16.9\% and 7.1\% of the total, respectively, and were the second and third largest input energy flow streams. E. grandis wood was the sole energy output from the system and averaged 290 GJ ha−1 yr−1 at the Hamakua plantation site. The total wood energy harvested from the system was estimated at 2.0 TJ ha−1. The input and output energy flows were used to calculate energy ratios for lower altitude and higher altitude plantation sites of 43.7 and 40.8 units of wood energy produced per unit of fossil energy input, respectively. Methods that will be used to harvest plantation E. grandis in Hawaii are currently not well established. Equipment selection, machine productivity (ha harvested h−1), and fuel consumption rates are important factors in the input energy total. Replacing assumptions with data from actual practice will reduce uncertainty and potentially improve energy ratio values.},
