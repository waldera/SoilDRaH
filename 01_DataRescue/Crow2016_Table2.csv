"Table 2. Soil carbon stocks (Mg C ha^-1) calculated by both the bulk density method (to 1 m) and the equivalent soil mass method (to 4000 g soil). Mean values (± one standard error) of the ﬁve soil cores quantiﬁed for each plot are reported for the pasture and eucalyptus plot pairs. The change in C stock between pasture and eucalyptus (D) and the percent change (% D) were calculated for each plot pair. Biomass C (Mg C ha^-1 ), both aboveground (AG) and belowground (BG) and the sum (AG CBG) also are reported for the eucalyptus plots.",,,,,,,,,,,
